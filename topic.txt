Given an integer array arr, return the number of distinct bitwise ORs of all the non-empty subarrays of arr.

The bitwise OR of a subarray is the bitwise OR of each integer in the subarray. The bitwise OR of a subarray of one integer is that integer.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



Example 1:

Input: arr = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one possible result: 0.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].
These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3.
There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 109

933. Number of Recent Calls

You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the RecentCounter class:

RecentCounter() Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time t, where t represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of 
requests that has happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of
requests that have happened in the inclusive range [t - 3000, t].
It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

 

Example 1:

Input
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Explanation
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3

374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

496. Next Greater Element I
Easy

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.



Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
